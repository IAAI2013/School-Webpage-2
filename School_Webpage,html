    <h1>Welcome to Ningbo British International School <em>(Nbis)</em>.</h1>


    <p>The school has now been in operation for <strong>19 years</strong>, growing from a fledgling operation with just
        <small>6 students, two teachers
            and a principal</small>, to the current vibrant learning community of about <b>500 students from nearly 50
            countries and regions
            with teaching staff recruited from around the world</b>. The school now aspires to become <i>a leader in
            International
            Education in Zhejiang Province</i>.<br><br>


        Students attending NBIS are required to hold an international passport. Class sizes are capped to be as
        low as
        practically possible, and we have 2 teachers per class up to Year 6.<br><br>


        Holding degrees from well-credentialed universities, western teachers come fully qualified to teach and
        represent many
        years of experience in their areas of teaching expertise. The local Chinese staff are also <sup>highly
            competent</sup>, most with
        English Language degrees, Chinese teaching qualifications and bilingual skills.<br><br>


        Despite the rigour attached to such curriculum offerings, we manage to keep the friendly <strong>‘family
            feel’</strong> alive through a
        very active PTA and Student Council, ensuring that school wide social events are held regularly and are
        very well
        attended and supported.<br><br>


        Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) acts in an informal governing role and assists me, as CEO, in the
        running of the
        school, long term planning and policy development.<br><br>


        NBIS is a great school, with excellently behaved students, very competent staff, positive input from
        parents, credible
        curriculum offerings and strong, on-going support from the Wanli Education Group and the Ningbo
        Government. The school
        is an authorized examination centre for Cambridge International Examinations.
